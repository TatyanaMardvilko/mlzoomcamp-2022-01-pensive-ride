# mlzoomcamp-2022-01-pensive-ride
This is a Midterm project for ML Zoomcamp 2022 (TODO: apply everything we learned)

## Problem description
The aim of this project understand which major factors contribute to test outcomes. This problem is very important in our days. The main goal is correctly predict academic perfomance. 


## Dataset
This project based on [Students Perfomans in Exams](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/whenamancodes/students-performance-in-exams?resource=download). This data set consists of the marks secured by the students in various subjects.


### Virtual environment
I used pipenv package manager for create a virtual environment and install the dependencies, 
but you feel free to choose any other tools (conda, venv, etc.).
In case pipenv follow the steps below:
1. Open the terminal and choose the project directory.
2. Install pipenv by command 'pip install pipenv'
3. Install all packages with 'pipenv sync --dev'. This command create virtual environment 
the same as mine using pipfile.lock.
4. Activate this virtual environment by command 'pipenv shell'.
